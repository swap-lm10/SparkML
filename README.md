# SparkML
This contains code for the Jupyter notebook alongside and other details

Spark Machine Learning Project
This is a project that demonstrates how to perform machine learning with Spark using Jupyter Notebooks. In this project, we will use Spark's MLlib library to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop doing business with us).

Dataset
We will be using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about customers' demographics, services, and account information, as well as whether they churned in the past month. The file telco_customer_churn.csv in this repository contains a cleaned version of the dataset that we will use for this project.
